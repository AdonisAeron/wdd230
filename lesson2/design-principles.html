                <p class="sText">Amazon is a really good example of Hicks law. You will have many options when you go inside amazon, but they are broken down into categories.
                Outside this the main focus of the homepage is their search feature. By condensing all their options into categories as well as removing any need
                for any browsing the options presented to the user is mostly minimized.

                <p class="sText">While at first glance this website may not look like it follows the Rule of Thirds, it actually does quite nicely.
                    By placing the main amount of text in the bottom left space and having the interesting imagery in the background hit almost every other point 
                    it's pretty easy to understand where everything is.

                <img class="sImage" src="images/chrome_JwYAhVXmIq.png" alt="Obermayer homepage from a mobile view.">
                <p class="sText">Obermayer is a really good example of repetition on all their versions. Every time you see their site you are greated with their grayish blue
                    banner that has their name and yellow logo. The yellow is repeated for almost every call to action and to represent something is an option on their site.
                    This repeated nature makes it very easy to navigate their site, even if you're seeing it from a different perspective for the first time.
